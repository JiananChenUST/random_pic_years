## qvb condensation

left column: the condensation considering Sk. (0 or (delta p/ g) ) 

right column: the condensationt do not considersing the Sk. 

When we do not considering the sk (we only consider negative value of qvb_mp= qvb_cond), as shown in the right column, the condensation pattern is relatively messy.

But when we filter the qvb_cond where the the vectical motion is downward. the condensation pattern is neat with two local maximum area.

## Other condensation rate 



left column: the qt_cond is denoted by the black contour lines. the qvb condensation considering Sk is shaded.

right column: the xs_cond calculate by our equation.
