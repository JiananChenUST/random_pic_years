The two maximum area are indeed expected from our columnwise condensation 


## Reason 1
In the figure below:
The right column is the figure I often show to you. The condensation rate in the y (cross mountain) direction.

The left column shows two contours. 
1. qvb_cond_sk means qvb_cond filtered by sk (dash). 
2. xs_cond_sk means xs_cond filtered by sk (solid).

## Reason 2
20, 40, 60, 80 contours levels are provided here.

### The below is the 20 contour lvls
